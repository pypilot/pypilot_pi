mdnsd - embeddable Multicast DNS Daemon

This package is intended for software developers and integrators, there isn't really anything here for an end 
user. More info is available at http://dotlocal.org/mdnsd/ or by emailing me.  The license is GPL and BSD, with 
alternative licensing available upon request if needed.

You should be able to just type make and it will build the included example apps.  Otherwise, check out mdnsd.h 
to get started, the API is as simple as I could make it, but I hope to find some easier/better ways to improve it 
in the future.  Also included are some other utilities, sdtxt.* for service discovery TXT record 
parsing/generation, and xht.* for simple fast hashtables, and 1035.* which mdnsd uses for standalone dns parsing.
